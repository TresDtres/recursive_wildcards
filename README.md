## Recursive Wildcard Modifier
# How it Works
The user selects an input file to edit.
The user enters the desired text to be added at the beginning and the end of each line.
The user specifies the output file path where the modified file will be saved.
Clicking the "Edit File" button triggers the editing process.
The program reads the contents of the input file.
Each line in the input file is modified by adding the specified text at the beginning and the end.
The modified lines are written to the output file.
The user can then access the modified file from the specified output file path.
